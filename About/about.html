      <p class="e-content">
        I am currently studying Game Design and Electrical Engineering at the
        University of Witwatersrand. Once I have finished the current degree I'm
        in, which is a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Digital Arts, I plan
        on branching into Information Engineering and getting my honours degree
        in that.
      </p>

      <p class="e-content">
        The reason I have chosen these degrees is beacuase I have an interest in
        engineering specifically Electrical Engineering and I love games. I have
        been playing them since I was a young kid. I thought since I love them
        so much and such an impact on my life that I would try and design and
        evelop them and so far I love it.

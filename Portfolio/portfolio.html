        Aquascape was a game that I made with two other students, Jodi Chapson
        and Kamogelo Maimela. It was a new experience to try and make a polished
        game with other people. One of the important aspects to this game was
        that it needed a save system as it is an idle game. I focused on that a
        lot and learnt quite a bit about saving data. It was also a lot of
        balancing due to the amount of data design. It was really fun working
        with these designers and developers and I learnt alot about being in a
        group with other people from planning and source control on github.
